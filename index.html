         <p> Hi!!!,I’m Ariharan s, a third-year Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE) student with a strong interest in real-world applications of technology, especially in embedded systems and full stack development. My project work reflects a blend of both hardware and software, aiming to solve practical problems using smart and automated systemsOne of my key projects involves an automated vehicle number plate recognition system using the ESP32-CAM module, integrated with IR sensors for entry and exit detection. This project captures vehicle images, sends them to a Flask server, and uses OCR (EasyOCR/Tesseract) to extract license plate numbers. The data is then logged and displayed on a live dashboard with vehicle details, time, and direction—all without the use of a servo motor. I’ve also implemented serial communication, CSV logging, and real-time image capture for this system. It’s part of a larger goal to develop a smart parking and monitoring solution.Alongside hardware, I’m currently pursuing a Full Stack Development course covering HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, MongoDB, Express, and API integration. My focus is on learning how to build responsive web applications that can interact with IoT devices and manage databases efficiently. This complements my hardware background and gives me the ability to build complete end-to-end solutions—from data collection on embedded devices to cloud storage and user-friendly web interfaces.
These experiences are shaping me into a versatile developer who can create impactful systems combining electronics and modern web technologies.
